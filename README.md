# Stock Picking Strategies Based on Financial Factors
This project is an individual quant trading strategy research for a hedge fund boss. It builds the framework to backtest the effectiveness of a total of more than 1000 financial factors (ROE, PE, etc.) on China A-share market. These factors are basic raw data from financial statements, balance sheets, income statement..... Many "derivative" financial factors, such as TTM value, year-on-year, month-on-month, etc., are calculated manually.

**Motivation:**
Although many strategies whatever stock picking strategies or timing strategies are constructed based on price and volume information, the real "secret" behinds a mature trading strategy must be based on real financial data information, as what the mutual fund managers do. The reason is that many digged factors base only on pure data mining techniques and are lack of theoretical support, and technical analysis has already become familiar and useless as the market efficiency increases. That means the basic financial factor information is still important for quantitative tadings as the "core logic".
